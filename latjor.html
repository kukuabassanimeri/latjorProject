		<h2>SOUTH SUDAN YOUTH LEADERSHIP SCHOLARS NETWORK PROGRAM</h2>
		<h3>MOTTO:<i>“Empowering South Sudan’s Youth To Tribalize New Horizons”</i></h3>
		<p>South Sudan Youth Leadership Scholars Network Program (SSYLNET) is a youth-led non-profit organization founded in 2023 by passionate and Visionary South Sudanese college students with the core mission to empower and elevate young people in South Sudan by providing them with access to transformative opportunities whose focal point includes scholarship programs, social entrepreneurship programs, leadership development programs, and ethical mentorship as well as opportunities to engage in community development projects and advocacy efforts by way of constructing a strong network of young leaders who can work collectively to drive positive and ethical social change in the Republic of South Sudan.

        SSYLNET envisions empowering young leaders to drive positive change in the realm of environmental sustainability by recognizing the urgency of addressing the pressing issue of climate change and its profound impact on communities, ecosystems, and the well-being of future generations in South Sudan. Our efforts are dedicated to influencing climate policies through evidence-based solutions by fostering a transformative wave of change in climate-related issues.

        Women's empowerment lies at the heart of our organization. We firmly acknowledge the pivotal role women play in shaping societies, and thus, we place a strong emphasis on breaking down barriers and challenging stereotypes in South Sudan by striving to foster gender equality by empowering women to reach their full potential.

        The organization seeks to build a network of young leaders and scholars in South Sudan who are committed to transforming their country and creating positive change with a grand mission to create opportunities for young people to develop their leadership skills, gain knowledge and experiences, and use their skills to make ethical transformations in South Sudan. Many talented young people lack the financial resources and support they need to pursue higher education, limiting their opportunities for personal growth and professional success.

        We recognize the conceivable of young people as key drivers for transformative changes and seek to create opportunities for them to realize their full potential and make contributions to the development of the country.
